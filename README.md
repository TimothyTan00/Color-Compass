# 🎨 Color Compass: A Fashion Assistant for Colorblind Users

## 📌 Overview
**Color Compass** is a mobile-first app designed to help individuals with color vision deficiency — like myself — navigate the world of fashion with confidence. As someone with red-green color blindness that affects my entire color spectrum, I often struggle with determining whether my outfit looks cohesive or whether colors match at all. This app aims to remove that uncertainty by identifying colors from photos and evaluating outfit harmony using color theory and (eventually) machine learning.

This project combines personal passion with practical technology, aiming to create an accessible, stylish, and empowering tool for anyone facing similar challenges.

## 🧠 Motivation
Fashion is a powerful form of self-expression, but for many colorblind individuals, it becomes a daily guessing game. I created this app because:
- I often can’t tell if certain colors match (e.g., blue vs. purple, green vs. yellow).
- Subtle hue differences can make or break an outfit, and I can’t always rely on others for help.
- I wanted an intuitive, real-time solution that could make color matching accessible—and fun.

## 🔹 Key Features
- **Color Detection from Photos**  
  Upload a photo, snap one in the moment, or point your camera for real-time detection of the exact color names of selected clothing items (or any object).

- **Color Coordination Suggestions**  
  Basic rule-based matching using complementary, analogous, and triadic color theory to evaluate outfit harmony.

- **User Feedback System** *(Coming Soon)*  
  Like or rate your own outfits so the app can learn your personal style preferences over time.

- **AI-Enhanced Outfit Matching** *(Future Expansion)*  
  Use machine learning models trained on curated fashion datasets to provide personalized, trend-aware suggestions.

## 🧰 Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Frontend**: React Native / Flutter (mobile-first design)
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for color extraction
- **ML (Future)**: Scikit-learn or TensorFlow (for personalized recommendations)
- **Database**: Firebase or PostgreSQL for storing user preferences and outfit history

## 🙋‍♂️ Why This Project Matters
This isn't just a technical project — it's a solution to a real challenge I face daily. It reflects my passion for accessibility, user-first design, and using AI for personal empowerment. I hope this project inspires new ways to combine empathy and engineering.
